# Hospital Drug Usage Analysis  

## Overview  

This repository contains a time-series analysis of hospital drug usage data. The project explores different predictive modeling approaches to forecast drug demand, identify seasonal patterns, and analyze key drivers of drug consumption in healthcare facilities.  

## Objective  

The main goals of this analysis are:  
- Forecasting hospital drug usage using various time-series models.  
- Identifying seasonal and trend-based patterns in drug consumption.  
- Evaluating the performance of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models.  

## Data  

The dataset includes:  
- **Date-based drug usage records**  
- **Hospital-level drug consumption trends**  
- **Drug categories and prescription frequencies**  
- **Seasonal variations in drug demand**  

## Methodologies  

We have applied the following models:  

### Time Series Models  
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** ‚Äì Traditional statistical forecasting method.  
- **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)** ‚Äì Extension of ARIMA that accounts for seasonality.  

### Machine Learning Models  
- **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)** ‚Äì A powerful tree-based algorithm for time-series forecasting.  

### Deep Learning Models  
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks)** ‚Äì A recurrent neural network for capturing temporal dependencies.
